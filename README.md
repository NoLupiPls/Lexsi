## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

There are many repositories available on GitHub, but I didn't find a single bot in Telegram for personal computer management on Windows OS. That's why I created one.

Of course, no bot will serve all your needs, as your needs may be different. So I will add more in the near future. You can also suggest changes by branching this repository and creating a pull request or opening a problem.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Built With

* Aiogram
* PyAytoGUI
* Python-dotenv
